# Pytorch implementation of [**LeNet**](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf)
This is the first paper I am review/implementing for my project: "Ten Papers && Ten Implementations"


# Overview 
LeNet-5 consists of two sets of convolutional and average pooling layers, followed by a flattening convolutional layer, then two fully-connected layers and finally a softmax classifier.
